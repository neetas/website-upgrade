Not shackled to any one sound, Meraqi's music begins live, weaving together glitchy electronics with soulful songwriting, powerful hooks and instrumental prowess. Deep bass, haunting vocals and grass-roots grooves meet in a kaleidoscopic musical experience falling somewhere between a sweaty underground rave and a smoky late-night vinyl discovery.
